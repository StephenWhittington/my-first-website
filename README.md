1. Stream-one
2. Stream-two
3. Stream-Three

Using Html5 i used the div element and added logos and links to different types of web developing programs/languages and then styled everything with CSS.

<h1>Stream-One</h1>
		<div class="card">
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">
				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/HTML5_Badge.svg/600px-HTML5_Badge.svg.png" width="400" height="300" />
				<h2>HTML5</h2>
			</a>
			
As you can see i used "div" "a href" and "img src" to add the logo and link to this README file, I have used this a lot in this project and this is just an example. I also in the README.md file changed the size of the logo so it is a resonable size.
